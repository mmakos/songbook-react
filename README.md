# Michał Makoś Songbook

New version of my songbook. Written in modern technology stack: TypeScript + React.js + MUI on frontend.
Backend code will not be public (due to security reasons), but believe me, there is not much happening there.

[![build & deploy](https://github.com/mmakos/songbook-react/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mmakos/songbook-react/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml)

For now, this songbook is in development stage. Test version is available at [songbook.mmakos.pl](https://songbook.mmakos.pl).

At the end it will be available on [my main songbook domain](https://spiewnik.mmakos.pl) (for now there is an old version of my songbook).
